      "Great pizza and quite affordable at the same time. The crust is delicious
      and holds up to the weight and the quality of the rest of the ingredients,
      while the sauce really draws everything together. I love to grab a slice
      whenever I pass through Okotoks!"

    "...Went to Okotoks for busker fest.We didn’t want food from a food truck,
    rather a place to sit and eat. As a small business owner that has to compete
    with chain stores I always seek out an independent. A google search led us
    to Mamas Pizza. I will admit the outside appearance was not inviting. The
    dark tint on the window drew attention to the webs of glass at the door. I
    opened the door and saw a few people dining. A cheery waitress promptly
    greeted us. She brought the menu offered a beverage while we looked it over.
    She returned with our drinks and asked if we had eaten there before, told us
    a little about the history of the restaurant explained the homemade from
    scratch dishes, I asked what she would recommend and she said everything..
    Her hospitality, attitude and genuineness were 10 star.. Our food came and I
    couldn’t believe how amazing it all looked. The presentation and portion
    sizes were evident of attention to detail.. I’ve never seen a donai..."
