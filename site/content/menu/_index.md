      Great pizza and quite affordable at the same time. The crust is delicious and holds up to the weight and the quality of the rest of the ingredients, while the sauce really draws everything together. I love to grab a slice whenever I pass through Okotoks!

      The food is amazing. We ordered cutlets, chef's salad and pizza. Everything was so yummy! If you are looking for a delicious meal, this is the place!
